AWS EC2 Security Hardening Guide

Task 5.1: Check the OS Users

	Step 1: Check Recent Logins

Run the following command to see who has recently logged into the system:

	sudo aureport --auth

sudo: Runs the command with superuser privileges.
aureport --auth: Displays authentication logs.

	Step 2: Check Currently Logged-in Users

	who

Displays a list of currently logged-in users.

	Step 3: Attempt to Remove the Unauthorized User

	sudo userdel -r chaos-user

userdel: Deletes the user.
-r: Removes the userâ€™s home directory and mail.

If the user is logged in, the command will fail and return a process ID (PID).

	Step 4: Kill the Process (Force Logout)

	sudo kill -9 ProcNum

kill -9: Forcefully terminates the process.
ProcNum: Replace this with the actual PID from the previous step.

	Step 5: Verify the Unauthorized User is Gone

	who

The chaos-user should no longer appear in the output.

	Step 6: Delete the User Again

	sudo userdel -r chaos-user

Now, this command should succeed.

	Step 7: Verify No Other Suspicious OS Users

	sudo cat /etc/passwd | grep -v nologin

cat /etc/passwd: Displays system users.
grep -v nologin: Filters out service accounts that cannot log in.

Standard users like root, sync, shutdown, and halt should remain.


Task 5.2: Update SSH Security

	Step 1: Check the SSH Configuration File

	sudo ls -l /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Lists the file details, including its last modified date.

	Step 2: Edit the SSH Configuration File

	sudo vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Opens the file in the vi editor.

	Step 3: Enable Line Numbering in vi

	:set number

Displays line numbers for easier navigation.

	Step 4: Disable Password Authentication
Locate: PasswordAuthentication yes
Press a to enter edit mode and change it to: #PasswordAuthentication yes

	Step 5: Enable Key-Based Authentication
Locate: #PasswordAuthentication no
Remove the # to uncomment it: PasswordAuthentication no

This ensures only SSH key-based logins are allowed.

	Step 6: Save Changes and Exit vi

	:wq

	Step 7: Restart the SSH Service

	sudo service sshd restart

Restarts the SSH daemon to apply the new security settings.

Summary

âœ… Removed an unauthorized user from the system.
âœ… Investigated their access method.
âœ… Secured SSH by disabling password authentication.
âœ… Restarted the SSH service to enforce security changes.
